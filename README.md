This project was an attempt to bring Hackerrrank into our good old VS Code as an extension. This extension allows us to levarage the in-built debugging tools, version control system, and infinite customizability of VS Code.

Hackerrank does not come with debugging tools and neither has direct integration with Github for version control. Snippet support is not very flexible as well. Most of the developers are much adept to VS Code and would rather prefer coding here than on the hackerrank platform. This is where this extension comes in!
